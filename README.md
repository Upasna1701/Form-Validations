#   Frontend Form Validations

This repository provides basic frontend validations for forms, ensuring a smoother user experience and data integrity. The validations include:

1) Regex Validation: Blocks users from entering certain characters if the field does not require them.

2) Character-Specific Validation: Fields allow various character inputs, but display errors if an inappropriate character is entered.

3) Copy-Paste Prevention: Users are restricted from copying and pasting values into the fields.

4) Autocomplete Prevention: Autocomplete suggestions are disabled for enhanced user control.

Customize the validations according to your form's specific requirements for a secure and user-friendly input experience.
